      <br>My name is Jocelyn Palomera but most people call me Jocy! I attend the University of California, Riverside as a first generation student with a Psychology major with a minor in Education. I don’t have any job experience but I am heavily involved in extracurriculars which have taught me many useful skills I could apply to a job. Along with my people skills I also have a lot of good qualities that would help in my profession. 
I spent over two hundred hours volunteering in the Youth Advisory Committee for the City of Perris. YAC is a professional youth leadership and mentorship organization focused on civic engagement and community service. Members participate and coordinate various informational, educational and fun activities that promote the youth of the Perris community. As historian, I managed and promoted upcoming city events via posters and social media. As a representative, I could vote on important decisions and would often speak in front of city council. Another extracurricular I was involved in was AVID. AVID is designed to help students develop the skills they need to be successful in college. The program placed special emphasis on growing writing, critical thinking, teamwork, organization and reading skills which can all help in the workplace. In 2018 I earned 1st Place in the AVID RIMS Write-Off by writing on the topic of use of social media in college. I was also a part of the program called “Link Crew”  which planned monthly events/meetings for freshmen, assisting freshmen in their transition from middle school to high school. All of these programs taught me useful skills and gave me experiences that made me who I am today. I am so happy I chose to be involved and join all the extracurriculars I did because I now have experience working with people and money. 
Outside of school I took a CPR, AED, and First Aid course and got certified. I have the ability to work under pressure so I would be a great asset to any team. I grew up speaking Spanish so I would definitely consider myself to be bilingual. I took ASL 4 honors in high school so I am also decent in sign language but wouldn’t say I'm fluent. I would consider myself to be proficient in Google Docs, Slides, and Sheets. Some of my hobbies would include painting, sewing, and makeup. I feel as though my creativity is what is going to help me become a great psychologist. I have some activity ideas which I could apply to my profession to help make things fun for kids. 
In the future I see myself working in an elementary school as a school psychologist. All my life I’ve known that I wanted to work with kids. In YAC I got the opportunity to run a summer arts and crafts workshop for kids and that confirmed I chose the right career path for me. I believe I have patience, compassion, and understanding which are all qualities that would help me work with children. I was a troubled kid once and would like to help out those who were once in that position.
